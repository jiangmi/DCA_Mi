# DCA++

With the DCA++ project, we aim to gain insight into the fascinating physics of strongly correlated electron systems by employing modern quantum cluster methods.
The DCA++ code provides a state of the art implementation of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) and its DCA<sup>+</sup> extension.
High scalability and portable performance allow to exploit today's leadership computing systems.
