Test sigma(K=(pi,0),iwn) with the previous data sigma_w_K=pi0_reference and sigma_K_w=piT_reference as reference 
(including the errorbar as last column)                                
                                                                       
Note that this is not lattice self-energy desired in DCA+. Instead we test sigma from QMC solver!

================================================

show_hdf5.py is for showing the values of new sigma(K=(pi,0),iwn) and sigma(K, pi*T)
